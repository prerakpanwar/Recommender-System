# Recommender-System
This movie recommender system recommends top 6 similar movies as per the input movie.

Developed a content-based movie recommender system using Python and various machine learning libraries |
Gathered and preprocessed movie data from a dataset, including cleaning and handling missing values |
Implemented vectorization techniques to convert movie features into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms |
Utilized cosine similarity to compute the similarity between movies based on their feature vectors |
Designed the recommender system to provide top 6 movie recommendations for a given movie input |

Technologies Used: Python| NumPy | Pandas | Scikit-learn| Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques | Vectorization | Stemming | Cosine similarity

Project flow: 1.Data --> 2.Preprocessing --> 3.Model --> 4.Website --> 5.Deploy.

NOTE: USED LOCAL HOST FOR RUNNING THE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM.
