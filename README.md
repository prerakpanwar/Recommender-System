# Recommender-System
This movie recommender system recommends top 6 similar movies as per the input movie.

Developed a content-based movie recommender system using Python and various machine learning libraries |
Gathered and preprocessed movie data from a dataset, including cleaning and handling missing values |
Implemented vectorization techniques to convert movie features into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms |
Utilized cosine similarity to compute the similarity between movies based on their feature vectors |
Designed the recommender system to provide top 6 movie recommendations for a given movie input |

Technologies Used: Python| NumPy | Pandas | Scikit-learn| Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques | Vectorization | Stemming | Cosine similarity

Project flow: 1.Data --> 2.Preprocessing --> 3.Model --> 4.Website --> 5.Deploy.

NOTE: I used pycharm for this Project and ran this command to run my recommender system "streamlit run application.py". Also, you have to login to TMDB to get your API key, You can use mine and if it is not working then you need to create your account in TMDB to get a new API for you. "https://www.themoviedb.org/"
